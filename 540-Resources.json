I'm also a patron of the arts and a fan of Broadway musicals (my opinion is that the performing arts are the purest form of art remaining). Work related, my interests are mostly at the data storage and transport layers. I'm an API evangelist, and I'm always trying to learn new technologies and techniques for organizing and optimizing data requests (though it is difficult to keep up with all of them).",

          REAL\" job out of college was as a Software Engineer for Dish Network (Echostar). I worked on the software that powered the set-top-boxes (STBs) that are in living rooms of Dish Network customers. I later transitioned to contribute to (and eventually lead) the team that built web-based apps that ran on Dish STBs (games, social media, news). In fact, if you have a Hopper and have ever player the BlackJack and Scrambler games, I was the primary developer for both... and I contributed and led the team on many of the other apps."
